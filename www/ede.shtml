<p>EDE is an <B>Emacs lisp</B> program which implements an environment
similar to those found in IDEs (Integrated Development Environment).
While Emacs is the premier development environment, and has lots of
support for this activity, EDE brings many divergent commands used for
debugging, and compiling and sticks them into a simple menu next to
commands used for maintaining a project file.</p>

<P>What EDE brings to the party is an awareness of how a singular source
file fits into the overall scheme of an application.  EDE knows what
target a file belongs to, and will offer the correct options
automatically when debugging or compiling.</p>

<P>EDE is an object oriented program which defines a set of core
virtual objects representing a project and target.  Actual
implementations expound upon these providing the actual
functionality.</p>

<P>Two project file types are included.  <em>project-am</em> is the
original project mode which implements these ideas directly on
pre-existing automake files.  (It cannot created them).
<em>ede-proj</em> is a different implementation which maintains state
in a file called <tt>Project.ede</tt>.  This mode autogenerates your
Makefile whenever you compile so there is no need to learn make.
Unfortunatly this is only really useful for small projects.</p>

<P>EDE 1.0 will have ede-proj autogenerate automake files
which will be the default for large projects where the Makefile
generation is insufficient.</p>
